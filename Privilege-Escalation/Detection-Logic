üïµÔ∏è Detection Logic

üìò Description

Detects potential privilege escalation by monitoring for creation of new user accounts and modifications to privileged groups such as Administrators.



üîç SPL (Splunk Search Processing Language)

```spl
index=win_logs sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security 
(EventCode=4720 OR EventCode=4732 OR EventCode=4672)
| eval AlertType=case(
    EventCode=4720, "New User Account Created",
    EventCode=4732, "User Added to Privileged Group",
    EventCode=4672, "Special Privileges Assigned"
)
| table _time, AlertType, Account_Name, Target_Account_Name, Group_Name, host
| sort -_time
```



üß† Logic Explanation

| Event ID | Meaning                                  | Why it's important                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 4720     | A user account was created               | Indicates initial step in escalation    |
| 4732     | A user was added to a local group        | Confirms privilege elevation to a group |
| 4672     | Special privileges assigned to new logon | Confirms login with elevated privileges |



üîÅ Alternative (Simplified SPL)

```spl
index=win_logs EventCode=4720 OR EventCode=4732 OR EventCode=4672
```

Use this for broader monitoring or dashboards.
